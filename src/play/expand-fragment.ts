// The ExpandFragment play (T-016-02, story S-016-01, epic E-016) — the FOURTH registry entry of the
// casting engine and the demand-extraction primitive ONE NOTCH UPSTREAM of ProposeEpic: it clears a
// rough FRAGMENT (a felt "this is rough", a one-liner, a TODO) into a board-ready demand SIGNAL,
// where ProposeEpic clears a pulled signal into an epic CARD. The pipeline grows: fragment → expand
// → signal → propose → epic → decompose. A Blue/Green PERMANENT (card-model.md) — a reusable
// articulation play cast forever. The six per-play variation points (render, parse, gates, effect,
// budget, card) are collected into one `Play<ExpandFragmentInputs, Signal>` (`expandFragmentPlay`),
// registered onto the shelf-wide `registry`; the generic `castPlay` loop owns the fixed spine. This
// module owns only the play-specific judgment.
//
// DEPENDENCY DIRECTION (E-007 keystone): a concrete play depends UP onto the engine. This module
// imports `castPlay` + the `Play` contract from src/engine/; the engine never imports src/play/.
// Acyclic, exactly as propose-epic.ts / note.ts. The budget is inlined (not imported from the shelf —
// that edge would cycle).
//
// PURITY (house pattern): the play's `gates` is the pure `clear` (expand-core); its `effect` is the
// addon-free `expandFragmentEffect` (expand-effect); only `render`/`parse` call BAML in process (the
// addon's one-call-per-process limit is `bun test`-specific — a plain `bun` process, which the CLI
// is, runs both fine). So NO bun-test file value-imports this module — its logic is the engine's
// tested core + expand-core.test.ts + expand-effect.test.ts + the expand.test.ts bridge.
// `assembleExpandFragmentInputs`/`castExpandFragment` are the IMPURE verbs.

 *               value-link; its `cleared` echo lets a successful cast log three passed gate rows.
 *  - `effect` : `expandFragmentEffect` (expand-effect) — STAGES the signal under

 *  - `budget` : a single articulation's envelope (20m / 12k) — heavier than note's one-shot capture,
