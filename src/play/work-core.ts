// The `vend work` gesture's PURE core (T-024-03, story S-024-01, epic E-024) — the Confirm→Run→Settle
// surface (IA-6) at macro scale, the addon-free half of the counter gesture. Where work.ts is the
// impure shell (reads the board, casts the chain, drives the loop), THIS module is the parse + the
// render: the board → ranked signals, and the loop's signals/result → the human-facing production
// line (IA-7) and receipt (IA-6). Split out for the house testability reason (the steer-core / steer
// three-file discipline): work.ts value-imports the chain (the BAML native addon), so no `bun test`
// may value-import it — this pure module holds the load-bearing branching and is unit-tested.
//
// PURITY (house pattern): every export takes plain values and returns plain values — no fs, clock,
// network, process, seam, or addon. The ONE value import is `formatWallet` (wallet.ts), itself pure:
// the single source of two-denomination truth (IA-8), reused for both the stream meter and the
// receipt balance so the meter never lies. The engine/wallet types are TYPE-ONLY (erased).
