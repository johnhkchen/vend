// The executor selector (T-035-01) — resolves which {@link Executor} a cast runs on,
// defaulting to Claude so that with no env/opt set every existing cast is byte-identical.
// Lives in its OWN module (not executor.ts) on purpose: it value-imports `ClaudeExecutor`
// from claude.ts, and claude.ts value-imports `ExecutorTimeoutError` from executor.ts — so
// putting the selector in executor.ts would form a runtime cycle (executor → claude →
// executor). Sitting on top of both keeps the dependency graph acyclic:
//   select.ts ─▶ claude.ts ─▶ executor.ts   (and select.ts ─▶ executor.ts for the type).
//
// The registry is a PARAMETER (injectable), which is what makes "selects an alternate when
// requested" unit-testable today — a test passes a registry containing a stub factory —
// before the second real executor exists. T-035-02 simply adds its `openai` factory to
// `builtinExecutors`.
